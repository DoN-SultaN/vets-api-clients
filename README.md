# vets-api-clients

This repository contains resources for accessing vets-api as a third-party
client. It includes API specifications, sample clients, and general
access information.

**Third-party access to vets-api is currently in limited beta status, and
is only available in development environments.**

## Available Services

### Document Upload Service
- The [VBA document upload service](services/vba_documents) provides a 
mechanism to submit VBA forms and documents to VA.
